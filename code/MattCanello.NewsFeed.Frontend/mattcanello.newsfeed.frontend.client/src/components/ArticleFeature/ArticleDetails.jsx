              We chose Raymond, Row and Rodney as babies.
              They are gentel, curious personalities - who sometimes strut into the house in pursuit of spare
              rains...

              I loved alpacas when I was a child, but never did I think I would own three. I love their little
              faces and the fact that they are big, but so gentle. They are very shy and not very confident.

              We moved house last year and our new home has a bit of land. I had always wanted to have more
              animals; I read up on everything about alpacas for so long that it came to the point where I was
              like: “Right, I'm going to go for it. We could give them a wonderful home.” And we have.
